# Exercise: Working With References

Let’s see references in action now. We will be going over the reference we looked at in the lecture, but viewing it in usdview.

1. Head over to Visual Studio Code and **run** the following code to open the file in usdview:

Windows:
```powershell
.\scripts\usdview.bat .\composition_arcs\references\simple_example\red_cube.usd
```
Linux:
```sh
./scripts/usdview.sh ./composition_arcs/references/simple_example/red_cube.usd
```

What are some of the things you notice? How is this layer organized? Keep these questions in mind as we will go over it again later on, when we talk about encapsulation.

As you might have noticed all prims are underneath and contained within the World prim.

2. **Close** the window and head back to Visual Studio Code.
3. **Open** `composition_arcs/references/simple_example/references_simple.usd` in Visual Studio Code, and notice where the references are being made.

We can also see that there are `PropertySpecs` being applied to each.

Looking at these `PropertySpecs`, how do these affect the layer? Does it also affect `red_cube.usd`?

4. Head back into Visual Studio Code and scroll down to view more of `references_simple.usd`. Take a look at `blue_cube_01` and when you scroll down further you can see that it is being used as a reference for `blue_cube_02` and `blue_cube_03`.

Knowing all this, what are some assumptions we can make about how this scene will look?

5. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, **run** the following code to open the file in usdview.

Windows:
```powershell
.\scripts\usdview.bat .\composition_arcs\references\simple_example\references_simple.usd
```
Linux:
```sh
./scripts/usdview.sh ./composition_arcs/references/simple_example/references_simple.usd
```

![](../../images/composition-arcs/image74.png)

We can also see where the references are being pulled from.

6. In the tree view, click on **`red_cube_01`** to select it, then click on the **Layer Stack** tab in the bottom right of usdview.

![](../../images/composition-arcs/image87.gif)

Here we can see in our layer stack that the `red_cube.usd` is part of it. So what does that mean? It means that we are targeting the data that is inside of `red_cube.usd` and composing it in our current layer.

7. Click on the **Composition** tab to the right of the *Layer Stack* tab to see the lists of the layers that compose the selected prim. Notice that the arc type is `reference`.

![](../../images/composition-arcs/image54.png)

We can also see the composition of `blue_cube_02` when selected.

Going back to the questions we asked before and some new questions:

Looking at these `PropertySpecs`, how do these affect the layer?

Does it also affect `red_cube.usd`?

What if we did not have a default prim?

Now after having a basic understanding let’s apply it to a scenario.

The script we're creating could simulate an artist interactively building a city or it could be a tool that will procedurally generate a city. Let’s say we need to create a row of buildings. We can set this up using references.

Let’s take a look at what assets we are using. You can also open these files in usdview. Here we have `skyscraperA` and `skyscraperE`.\

8. Go to `composition_arcs/references/exercise/references_exercise.py`

9. **Add** the following code within the `PART ONE` section:

```py
skyscraper_01 = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/World/skyscraperA_01")
skyscraper_01.GetPrim().GetReferences().AddReference(skyscraperA_relpath)
skyscraper_02 = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/World/skyscraperA_02")
skyscraper_02.GetPrim().GetReferences().AddReference(skyscraperA_relpath)
skyscraper_02_xformapi = UsdGeom.XformCommonAPI(skyscraper_02)
skyscraper_02_xformapi.SetTranslate(Gf.Vec3d(180, 0, 0))
```
Here we are creating two destination prims and both will have a reference to `skyscraperA`.

10. **Save** the file.
11. Let’s run the script to see it in action. In the terminal, **run** the following code:

Windows:
```powershell
python .\composition_arcs\references\exercise\references_exercise.py
```
Linux:
```sh
python ./composition_arcs/references/exercise/references_exercise.py
```

This will create a new layer called `city.usda`.

12. Now let’s view it in usdview. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, **run** the following code:

Windows:
```powershell
.\scripts\usdview.bat .\composition_arcs\references\exercise\city.usda
```
Linux:
```sh
./scripts/usdview.sh ./composition_arcs/references/exercise/city.usda
```

![](../../images/composition-arcs/image4.png)

Here we can see the same skyscraper is now in our scene twice. You can see where the reference is coming from by expanding World and selecting `skyscraperA_01` or `skyscraperA_02`. In the *Meta Data* tab, note the "references" field.
![](../../images/composition-arcs/image27.png)

We can also see this in the new `city.usda` that we authored. If you were to open `city.usda` in Visual Studio Code, you’ll see the following:

```usda
#usda 1.0
(
    metersPerUnit = 0.01
    upAxis = "Y"
)

def Xform "World"
{
    def Xform "skyscraperA_01" (
        prepend references = @../../lib/assets/envir/city/skyscraperA/skyscraperA.usd@
    )
    {
    }

    def Xform "skyscraperA_02" (
        prepend references = @../../lib/assets/envir/city/skyscraperA/skyscraperA.usd@
    )
    {
        double3 xformOp:translate = (180, 0, 0)
    }
}
```

Let’s add one more skyscraper reference into the stage.

13. Using similar code, add the following snippets to the `PART TWO` section of `references_exercise.py`

```py
skyscraper_03 = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/World/skyscraperE_01")
skyscraper_03.GetPrim().GetReferences().AddReference(skyscraperE_relpath)
skyscraper_03_xformapi = UsdGeom.XformCommonAPI(skyscraper_03)
skyscraper_03_xformapi.SetTranslate(Gf.Vec3d(340, 0, 0))
```

In this case we are using `skyscraperE` instead of `skyscraperA`.

14. **Save** the file.

15. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, **run** the following code:

Windows:
```powershell
python .\composition_arcs\references\exercise\references_exercise.py
```
Linux:
```sh
python ./composition_arcs/references/exercise/references_exercise.py
```

16. Now let’s view it in usdview. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, **run** the following code:

Windows:
```powershell
.\scripts\usdview.bat .\composition_arcs\references\exercise\city.usda
```
Linux:
```sh
./scripts/usdview.sh ./composition_arcs/references/exercise/city.usda
```

As we can see we now have a small city block. Our colleagues are able to still continue to work in their respective skyscraper assets while we continue to build out our city.

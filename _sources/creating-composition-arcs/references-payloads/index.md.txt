# References and Payloads

In this lesson, weâ€™ll explore two composition arcs in OpenUSD that allow us to create modular, efficient and flexible scene descriptions. References and payloads are essential for managing complex scenes, reusing assets, and optimizing performance in USD workflows.

Throughout this lesson, we will:

- Define references and payloads, and explain their roles in USD composition.
- Create and manipulate references and payloads using usdview and Python.
- Analyze how references and payloads affect opinion strength and composition order in USD scenes. 

These concepts are fundamental to creating efficient, scalable USD pipelines in various industries and will be covered in the following units:

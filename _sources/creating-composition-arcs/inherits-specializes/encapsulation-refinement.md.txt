# Encapsulation and Refinement

Both inherits and specializes arcs can target an encapsulated or unencapsulated prim as their source prim. Depending on whether the source prim is encapsulated or not, the broadcasting behavior of the inherits/specializes arc changes when the destination prim is referenced into another layer stack.

Inherits/specializes arcs become more useful when instancing comes into play. That will be covered more in-depth in a future module.

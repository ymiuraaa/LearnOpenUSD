Let's continue with the last lesson in this module, *LIVERPS Strength Ordering*. LIVERPS is a fundamental concept in USD that governs how different composition arcs are applied when creating a scene. This knowledge is key to understanding how USD resolves conflicts in opinions and determines the final state of a scene when multiple layers and composition operations are involved.

In this module, we will:

- Understand the meaning of the LIVERPS acronym.
- Learn about the hierarchy of composition arcs and their relative strengths.
- Explore the concept of layer stacks and how they relate to LIVERPS.
- Gain insight into how LIVERPS determines the composition of prims and properties on a USD stage.

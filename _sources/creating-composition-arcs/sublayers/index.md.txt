- Define layers and sublayers in the context of OpenUSD, and explain their roles in scene composition.
- Identify when and why to use sublayers in USD workflows.
- Create and manipulate sublayers using usdview and Python.
- Implement sublayers to organize USD content from multiple workstreams effectively.

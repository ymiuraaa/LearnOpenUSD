# Workstreams

In this lesson, weâ€™ll learn about organizing asset structures into workstreams using OpenUSD layer stacks. We will:

* Explain the purpose and benefits of organizing assets into workstreams.  
* Implement a layer stack structure to model parallel workstreams.   
* Apply best practices for managing layer stacks in OpenUSD pipelines.

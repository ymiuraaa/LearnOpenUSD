# Exercise: Your First Asset

Let’s take a look at `export.usd` in usdview.

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, **run** the following command:

Windows:
```powershell
.\scripts\usdview.bat .\asset_structure\exercise_01\export.usd
```
Linux:
```sh
./scripts/usdview.sh ./asset_structure/exercise_01/export.usd
```

Take a second to look at the tree view in the top left corner.

Notice that the mesh and material prims don't have a common ancestor prim that could be referenced to include them all together. Even though the “root” item in the tree view looks like an ancestor prim, it represents the stage’s pseudo-root and is not a defined prim. We can address this by creating an entry point prim and making all the current root prims its children.

2.  In Visual Studio Code, **open** the following file: `asset_structure/exercise_01/make_entry_point.py`

3. In our script, we will define a `World` prim under which the rest of the prims will be reparented. **Add** the code below into the block:

```py
# Move all root prims under new entry point prim.
editor = Usd.NamespaceEditor(stage)
for prim in root_prims:
    editor.ReparentPrim(prim, world_prim)
    # NamespaceEditor takes care of updating all relationship targets (e.g. material bindings)
    editor.ApplyEdits()
```

4. **Save** the file and then **run** the script using the following command:  
   
Windows:
```powershell
python .\asset_structure\exercise_01\make_entry_point.py
```
Linux:
```sh
python ./asset_structure/exercise_01/make_entry_point.py
```

5.  The output will now be in `lrg_bldgF.usd`. **Run** the following command so we can view this in usdview:

Windows:
```powershell
.\scripts\usdview.bat .\asset_structure\exercise_01\lrg_bldgF.usd
```
Linux:
```sh
./scripts/usdview.sh ./asset_structure/exercise_01/lrg_bldgF.usd
```

6. If the “root” dropdown is not expanded when the file opens, **expand** it now. Notice how all of our prims are now under `World`.

7. Now that we have a fully referenceable asset, we’ll create a new layer called `scene.usda` that contains three references of `lrg_bldgF.usd`. In Visual Studio Code, **run** the following command in the terminal:

Windows:
```powershell
python .\asset_structure\exercise_01\reference_asset.py
```
Linux:
```sh
python ./asset_structure/exercise_01/reference_asset.py
```

8. Next, take a look at our new file in usdview. **Run** the following command so we can open the file in usdview:

Windows:
```powershell
.\scripts\usdview.bat .\asset_structure\exercise_01\scene.usda
```
Linux:
```sh
./scripts/usdview.sh ./asset_structure/exercise_01/scene.usda
```

Notice that when referencing the building, all associated materials and geometry are also included. If we hadn't consolidated these into a single entry point, there would be no clear indication of what should be brought over.

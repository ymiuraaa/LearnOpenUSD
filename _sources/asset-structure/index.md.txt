# Asset Structure Principles and Content Aggregation

This module, *Asset Structure Principles and Content Aggregation*, is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively organize and structure assets in OpenUSD. By doing so, you'll improve collaboration, asset reuse, and overall pipeline efficiency.

Throughout this module, you’ll experiment with various OpenUSD features that facilitate best practices in asset structure and content aggregation. This includes establishing asset interfaces, leveraging layer stacks to organize parallel workstreams, and establishing model hierarchies. These principles will enable you to streamline collaborative workflows in your USD pipelines.

This module is designed for those with experience in 3D graphics and OpenUSD, providing you with the knowledge and skills to effectively use OpenUSD in your workflows. We encourage you to actively participate in the exercises and quizzes to enhance your learning experience.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:

* Implement the four key principles of scalable asset structures  
* Create and manage asset entry points and interfaces effectively  
* Organize prim hierarchies for improved clarity and efficiency  
* Design and implement workstreams using OpenUSD layer stacks and model kinds

# What Is Asset Validation?

Typical unit tests and automated testing of your data exchange implementation are encouraged, but you shouldn't stop there. You might be learning OpenUSD as you're developing. How do you know that you are authoring good quality and compliant USD content? That's where usdchecker comes in.

usdchecker is one of the tools that comes as part of the USD Toolset, the command-line tools included with OpenUSD. usdchecker can validate a USD stage or USDZ package using a set of defined rules to provide the best assurance that an asset will be properly interchangeable and renderable by Hydra.

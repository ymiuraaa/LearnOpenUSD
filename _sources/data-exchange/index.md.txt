# Developing Data Exchange Pipelines

This module, *Developing Data Exchange Pipelines* is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively implement data exchange processes using OpenUSD.

Throughout this module, you’ll explore the fundamentals of OpenUSD data exchange, learn techniques for data extraction and transformation, and gain hands-on experience in asset validation. This interoperable nature of OpenUSD is what allows you to leverage your existing 3D tools while developing data exchange pipelines, enabling seamless integration of OpenUSD workflows into your current production environment.

This module is designed for those with experience in 3D graphics and OpenUSD, providing you with the knowledge and skills to effectively use OpenUSD in your workflows and improve interoperability between different 3D applications and formats. We encourage you to actively participate in the exercises and quizzes to enhance your learning experience.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:

- Define key concepts related to OpenUSD data exchange.
- Explain the challenges associated with data exchange in OpenUSD.
- Implement basic data extraction techniques for geometry and materials using OpenUSD.
- Assess the quality and validity of OpenUSD assets using asset validation techniques.
- Develop a functional data exchange pipeline that incorporates extraction, transformation, and validation processes for OpenUSD assets.

# Prim and Property Paths

## What Is a Path?
In OpenUSD, a path represents the location of a prim or property within a scenegraph. The string representation for a prim path consists of a sequence of prim names separated by forward slashes (`/`), similar to file paths in a directory structure. The stage pseudo-root, which serves as the starting point for the hierarchy, is represented by a forward slash (`/`).

For example, the path `/World/Geometry/Box` represents a prim named `Box` that is a child of a prim named `Geometry`, which is a child of the root prim named `World`.

### How Does It Work?

Paths in OpenUSD are handled through the `pxr.Sdf.Path` class to encode path data including prims, properties (both attributes and relationships), and variants.

Prims are indicated by a slash separator, which indicates the namespace Child (ex: `"/geo/box"`)

Period separators after an identifier is used to introduce a property (ex: `"/geo/box.weight"`)

Variants are indicated by curly brackets, like this: (ex. `"/geo/box{size=large}"`)

They are used to:

1. **Uniquely identify prims and properties**. Each prim and property in a scene has a unique path that distinguishes it from other prims and properties. 
2. **Navigate the scene hierarchy**. Paths allow you to traverse the scene hierarchy via the USD stage and access specific prims.
3. **Specify locations for authoring**. When creating or modifying prims, paths are used to specify where the prims should be placed in the hierarchy on the USD stage.
4. **Query and filter prims**. Paths can be used to filter and select specific prims based on their location in the hierarchy using `Sdf.PathExpression`.

### Working With Python

![Path Python](../images/foundations/Path_Python.webm)

Here are a few Python functions relevant to paths in OpenUSD.

```python
# Import the Sdf class
from pxr import Sdf

# Return the path of a Usd.Prim as an Sdf.Path object
Usd.Prim.GetPath()

# Retrieve a Usd.Prim at the specified path from the Stage
Usd.Stage.GetPrimAtPath()
```

### Example 1: Getting, Validating, and Defining Prims at Path  

Each prim has a [path](https://openusd.org/release/glossary.html#usdglossary-path) to describe its location in [namespace](https://openusd.org/release/glossary.html#usdglossary-namespace).

For example, we defined a prim `hello` at path `/hello` and another prim `world` at path `/hello/world`.

We can retrieve prims using their path using [`GetPrimAtPath()`](https://openusd.org/release/api/class_usd_stage.html#a6ceb556070804b712c01a7968f925735). This will either return a valid or invalid prim. When using `GetPrimAtPath()` we should always check if the returned prim is valid before using it.

To check if a prim is valid we can use the [`IsValid()`](https://openusd.org/release/api/class_usd_object.html#ac532c4b500b1a85ea22217f2c65a70ed) method. Valid means that the prim exists in the stage. Invalid is when the prim does not exist in the stage or when the path is invalid.

```{note}
When using `GetPrimAtPath()`, it will return type `UsdPrim`. If our prim is of type `UsdGeom`, we will not be able to use `UsdGeom` API schema on it.
```

```{code-cell}
:emphasize-lines: 7-20

from pxr import Usd

stage: Usd.Stage = Usd.Stage.CreateNew("_assets/paths.usda")
stage.DefinePrim("/hello")
stage.DefinePrim("/hello/world")

# Get the primitive at the path "/hello" from the current stage
hello_prim: Usd.Prim = stage.GetPrimAtPath("/hello")

# Get the primitive at the path "/hello/world" from the current stage
hello_world_prim: Usd.Prim = stage.GetPrimAtPath("/hello/world")

# Get the primitive at the path "/world" from the current stage
# Note: This will return an invalid prim because "/world" does not exist, but if changed to "/hello/world" it will return a valid prim
world_prim: Usd.Prim = stage.GetPrimAtPath("/world")

# Print whether the primitive is valid
print("Is /hello a valid prim? ", hello_prim.IsValid())
print("Is /hello/world a valid prim? ", hello_world_prim.IsValid())
print("Is /world a valid prim? ", world_prim.IsValid())

stage.Save()
```
```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]

```

## Key Takeaways

Using `Sdf.Path` objects in OpenUSD provides a way to uniquely identify and locate objects (prims) within our scene hierarchy. We will use paths for authoring, querying, and navigating USD data effectively.

# Setting the Stage

Welcome to *Learn OpenUSD: Foundations*! In this first module, you'll build your understanding of the core building blocks that make up every USD scene. Think of this as learning the vocabulary and grammar before writing your first USD "sentences".

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- **Create and manipulate USD stages** - the top-level containers that hold your 3D scenes
- **Work with prims** - the fundamental building blocks that represent every element in your scene
- **Add properties to prims** - including attributes for data and relationships for connections
- **Navigate scene hierarchies** using prim and property paths
- **Choose the right USD file format** for your specific needs and workflows
- **Organize data with metadata** to enhance collaboration and pipeline efficiency
- **Handle time-varying data** using timecodes and time samples for animation

## Why This Matters

These concepts form the foundation for everything else in OpenUSD. Whether you're building complex scenes with composition arcs or creating custom schemas, you'll rely on stages, prims, and properties as your fundamental tools. Understanding these building blocks deeply will make advanced USD concepts much more intuitive.

## What's Next

Once you've mastered these fundamentals, you'll be ready to explore how USD's powerful composition system allows you to build complex scenes from reusable components - but first, let's start with the basics!

# OpenUSD Development Certification: What It Is and Why It Matters

To help qualify OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description) skills, NVIDIA collaborated with USD experts from around the world to establish the [OpenUSD Development professional certification](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/learn/certification/openusd-development-professional/) exam.

The OpenUSD Development certification proves your ability to create optimized pipelines, structure workflows for large projects, and apply best practices trusted by major studios and tech companies worldwide.

## Why OpenUSD Development Certification Is Important for 3D Developers

Teams working on unified 3D projects need standardized workflows, strong pipeline management, and a common technical languageâ€”precisely what Universal Scene Description delivers. However, itâ€™s important to keep in mind that USD is not just another file format, and building USD pipelines is not as simple as just swapping your existing files out with .usd (and we wouldnâ€™t want you to do that anyway). 

**Not everyone is building USD scenes the right way.**

OpenUSD is an open ecosystem with almost unlimited possibilities - you can do almost anything - so itâ€™s natural that there are a lot of ways you can do things wrong (or at least wrong enough to cause headaches later on). If your team lacks unified standards, you should expect costly inefficiencies, sloppy structures, and bad processes.

**Pipeline developers are essential.**

USDâ€™s unique structure, extensibility, and collaborative capabilities unlock incredible benefits, but require careful planning to seamlessly adapt existing workflows and processes into modern pipelines. Understanding, designing, and managing these systems requires expertise that's highly sought-after.

Certification helps you identify and grow true USD talent, giving you confidence that you're hiring and developing the right people for high-impact work. Ideally 10% of your teamâ€”or at least one or two people per projectâ€”should hold USD Development certification to anchor your pipelines with proven expertise.

## Practical Benefits of OpenUSD Certification for Pipelines and Collaboration

Certification isnâ€™t the end of the road with building USD expertise, but it provides a baseline qualification for USD development and **creates a shared foundation** that:

* Ensures everyone is **building on the same standards**.
* Sets a clear, **achievable target** as OpenUSDâ€™s boundaries continue to expand.
* Leads to **efficient workflows, better project outcomes**, and easier onboarding for new team members.
* **Updates as the technology evolves** ensuring experts remain abreast with the latest features and best practices.

At a minimum, certification verifies critical skills for building industry-ready 3D workflows and establishes a foundation for future-proof collaborationâ€”essential for any successful digital twin project or physical AI initiative.

# Refining Scenegraph Instances

In this lesson, you'll learn various techniques for refining scenegraph instances to introduce variety and customization while maintaining performance benefits. Here's what we'll accomplish:

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

* **Understand** the fundamental rules of instance editability and why they exist
* **Apply** different refinement techniques including deinstancing, refinement using variant sets, and hierarchical refinement
* **Evaluate** the performance impact of each refinement approach using stage statistics
* **Choose** the most appropriate refinement technique for specific use cases
* **Implement** complex refinement workflows that balance performance with authoring flexibility

# Authoring Scenegraph Instancing

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create and manage scenegraph instances in USD, including enabling instancing and implementing nested instancing hierarchies. Here's what we'll accomplish:

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

* **Explain** how scenegraph instancing works in USD and its relationship to the composition system
* **Create** scenegraph instances by enabling the `instanceable` metadata on prims
* **Analyze** stage statistics to understand the performance impact of instancing
* **Implement** nested instancing hierarchies for complex scene structures
* **Compare** the trade-offs between instancing performance and authoring flexibility
